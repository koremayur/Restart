# RESTART
Restart is beautiful iOS application with SwiftUI.

# ADVANCED APP DESIGN
The main goal of this mini-project is to inspire you on what we can accomplish with the SwiftUI framework.

# COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES
We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Appleâ€™s stock user interface library.

# PARALLAX EFFECT
By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect), we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.


# Content and Learnings
App Icon makes the first impression on the users' mobile devices. We could not take shortcuts without it if we want to upload our application to Apple's App Store.
